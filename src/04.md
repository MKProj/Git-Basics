## Git Remote 
When you work in a group, it is typical to collaborate with others using a Git server, or 
a website like Github (highly recommended). 

A `remote` is essentially a shared Git repository that allows for multiple collaborators. 
Now keep in mind collaborators work independently, and merge their changes when ready.
