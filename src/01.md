# Basic Workflows in Git  

---  

## Initializing a Repo
To start a git repository, you must first initialize the directory in which the project is located in. To do this 
you will need to use the `git init` command on the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows). This command 
creates a `.git` folder that contains all the tools and data necessary to contain various versions of our project. 

## Adding Changes 
To add a file's changes to the staging area, you will need to use the `git add` command, and use it 
like the following:  

```bash
$ git add <file>
```

If you want to add all the files, then use the wildcard, `git add *`. 

Now let's say there's files or directory you don't want added to the git repository (possibly build directories or large files), 
you can create a `.gitignore` file, and in it add the files or directories you want ignored. 

```
# .gitignore example 
example_directory/
example.txt
*.zip # this will ignore all zip files 
```

## Committing Changes & Status
So let's say you're satisfied with the changes you've made to the various files you've worked on. You could first see 
which file has been changed, and/or changes been added, once you've added the files that's had their changes made, what now?
Well when you add these files, they're in a staging area, to commit these changes to the repository, well it's exactly what you 
think, use `git commit`. 

```bash
git commit -m "A nice message about the changes" # Standard commit command 
git commit -a -m "A nice message" # Adds and commits 

```
