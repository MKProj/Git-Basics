# Basic Workflows in Git

## Initializing a Repo
To start a git repository, you must first initialize the directory in which the project is located in. To do this 
you will need to use the `git init` command on the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows). This command 
creates a `.git` folder that contains all the tools and data necessary to contain various versions of our project.
